          <h5>Impartiality Policy</h5>

          <ul>
            <p>NIWE is the legal entity responsible for Inspection Services.</p>

            <p>
              NIWE ensures impartiality in all our inspection services which
              will increase the confidence and trust of our clients. NIWE acts
              Transparent, Neutral, and this is intended to ensure impartiality.
              Our inspection services are insulated from conflict of interest,
              bias and prejudice.
            </p>
            <p>
              NIWE is committed to ensure that inspection services are
              undertaken in an impartial and unbiased manner with
              open-mindedness. NIWE personnel either internal or external
              committees thereof who could influence any inspection services are
              obliged to act impartially and shall not allow commercial,
              financial or other pressure that would compromise their
              impartiality in any way.
            </p>
            <p>
              Top management of NIWE is committed to impartiality. The
              inspection services are independent and the division is isolated
              from any other activities except for administrative approvals.
            </p>
            <p>
              Within NIWE, the certification division conducts risk assessment
              annually and where required in relation to specific activities or
              contracts on impartiality and potential conflict of interest
              relating to inspection services are reviewed by the impartiality
              committee.
            </p>
          </ul>
          <!--  principles-->
          <h5>Principles</h5>
          <ol style="list-style-type: disc">
            <p>
              To ensure impartiality, the following principles have been
              established and practiced
            </p>

            <li>
              NIWE Certification Division does not offer (and has never offered)
              any consultancy or any other form of consultancy to companies or
              individuals.
            </li>

            <li>
              Every inspection report/certificate prepared by an engineer will
              be reviewed by another engineer independently (who has not been
              involved in the inspection) to ensure that no interest shall
              predominate.
            </li>
            <li>
              NIWE Certification Division shall not state or imply that
              inspection would be simpler, easier, faster or less expensive.
            </li>

            <li>
              Individuals employed by or otherwise contracted to NIWE and
              involved in inspection services are required to document and
              record their current and past relationships with all companies.
              Any situation past or present which may present a potential
              conflict of interest is to be declared. NIWE will use the
              information to identify any threats to impartiality and will not
              use that individual in any capacity unless they can demonstrate
              that there is no conflict of interest.
            </li>

            <li>
              The employees involved in the inspection services are not and will
              not be put under any pressure (e.g. financial, trade,
              administrative, competitive, moral and other) and the execution of
              their obligations as an inspection body according to ISO/IEC
              17020:2012 will not be affected.
            </li>
            <li>
              NIWE Certification Division retains authority of Inspection
              Services.
            </li>

            <li>
              NIWE will take action to respond to any risks to its impartiality,
              arising from the actions of other persons, bodies or
              organizations, of which it becomes aware.

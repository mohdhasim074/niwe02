          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp NIWE in association with Riso DTU, Denmark has
          developed Numerical wind atlas of India. Numerical wind atlas
          methodologies have been devised to solve the issue of insufficient
          wind measurements. One such methodology is the so-called KAMM/WAsP
          method developed at Risø National Laboratory , Denmark
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In this methodology an approach called
          statistical-dynamical downscaling is used (Frey-Buness et al, 1995).
          The basis for the method is that there is a robust relationship
          between meteorological situations at the large scale and
          meteorological situations at the small scale.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Karlsruhe Atmospheric Mesoscale Model (KAMM)
          is used to model the mesoscale effects on the wind flow over India
          using modeling domains. KAMM calculates the mesoscale wind field using
          as input a description of the synoptic-scale climatology, as well as
          suitable orography and roughness maps. The climatology of the
          post-processed simulated wind fields and the local orography and
          roughnesses are subsequently used by WAsP (Wind Atlas Analysis and
          Application Programme) to predict the local wind climate.
        </p>
        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Creating a numerical wind atlas demands a
          large computational effort, and this computation effort increases with
          the size of the region to be mapped. India’s very large size means
          that it is not possible to perform the numerical wind atlas
          calculations at sufficient resolution for the whole country using a
          single modeling domain. Therefore it was decided to split the
          numerical wind atlas effort into twelve calculation domains ( See
          Fig.1).

        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The .lib files with 5 km resolution generated
          by KAMM have been verified with the .lib file generated by WAsP with
          reference to the actual measurements at very limited location. Summary
          of the verification for wind speed for each modeling domain at 10/20m
          agl. is given in table 2. ( For more details please refer Indian Wind
          Atlas book published by NIWE, Chennai)

        <p>
          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp The output of KAMM wind atlas file (.lib file)
          can be used as an input file of WAsP for the further analysis after
          the validation of results with nearby sites. Figure 2 gives an example
          of wind atlas file (.lib). This can also be referred to get an idea of
          wind characteristics over the given area at different height levels
          with reference to the roughness .

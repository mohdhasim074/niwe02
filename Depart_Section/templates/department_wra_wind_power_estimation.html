          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp In order to estimate the installable potential
          of the country, the KAMM generated meso scale wind power density map
          of 50 m level was integrated with the wind power density map generated
          with actual measurements (wherever data is available) and re-plotted
          the final wind power density maps by using GIS tool. Weightage is
          given only for the topographical features of the area. Later the total
          area of each wind power density range is calculated. Due to various
          reasons (habitat, forest, water bodies etc.), the entire land area
          covered by the isopleths cannot be expected to be available for
          installing wind farms. As land availability assessment was not a part
          of the project, the real land availability for wind farm development
          is not assessed for estimating the installable potential. On a
          conservative consideration, a fraction of uniform 2% land availability
          for all states except for Himalayan states, Northeastern states and
          Andaman Nicobar Islands has been assumed for energy estimation. In
          Himalayan states, Northeastern states and Andaman & Nicobar Islands,
          it is assumed as 0.5%. However the potential would change as per the
          real land availability in the windy area of each state. The
          installable wind power potential (name plate power) is calculated for
          each wind power density range by assuming 9 MW could be installed per
          square kilometer area . Finally the potential in the country at 50 m
          level with clearly stated assumptions is estimated as 49 GW (Refer
          Indian Wind Atlas published by NIWE for more information).

          &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp &nbsp Similar exercise without any validation has
          been carried out for 80 m level with the KAMM generated meso scale map
          and the results are calculated and given in an attached table. The
          estimated installable potential at 80 m level is found to be 102788 MW
          (See the Table.1.). Wind power density map at 80 m level is given in
          figure 1.

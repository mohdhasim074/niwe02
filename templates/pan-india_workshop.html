        Global Wind Day celebrations of National Institute of Wind Energy
        (NIWE), Chennai marked a new beginning with one-day workshop of “Pan
        India Research Network Meeting- Industry and Academia Amalgamation”.
      </p>
      <br />
      <p>
        This workshop is the start of a planned series of interactions between
        the Indian Academia and Wind power industry to create a conducive
        ecosystem to facilitate their amalgamation. Deliberations and
        brainstorming on the Research & Development needs of the Indian wind
        energy sector would help identify the way-forward for the indigenous
        research activities that would facilitate the Indian wind industry march
        to become the global leader in all the facets of the wind energy
        technology. This event was convened with an express intention to create
        a hub of synergy that would lead to Industry identified research
        requirements being taken up for research of national importance through
        a consortia of Academia, with support from MNRE through NIWE. This meet
        also provided an avenue for the Academics to showcase their areas of
        strengths in research.

        technical, financial and policy solutions presently available in India
        and brainstormed for finding solutions to meet the R&D needs of the
        industry. The workshop focused on some of the major issues that concerns
        the India wind power industry and its immediate requirements for
        oriented R&D from academia for Technology Readiness Level (TRL). The aim
        of bringing together all Indian Stakeholders under one roof for a day to
        have fruitful discussions was a success, the workshop deliberations
        stand as testimony to that.

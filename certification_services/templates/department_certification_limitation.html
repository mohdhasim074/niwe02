              </li>
              <li>
                If the scope of certification does not include all products
                manufactured by the client, and/or all locations/facilities,
                then the client shall ensure that use of the certificates
                restricted only for the scope covered in the certificate.
              </li>
              <li>
                The clients shall not use the certificates provided by NIWE in

                public trust, and shall not make any statement regarding its
                product certification that NIWE may consider to be misleading or

                Photocopies or electronic copies of original “paper” versions of
                the certificates may be in full color, and need to be
                watermarked or otherwise marked as being a copy of the original.
              </li>

              <li>

                altered or modified.
              </li>

              <li>
                Upon a reduction of the scope of certification, the client shall
                amend all advertising material referring to its certification to
                properly reflect the reduced scope.
              </li>

                measures as directed by NIWE.
              </li>

              <li>
                Contractual obligation: Correct use of the certificate is a
                contractual obligation and will be monitored at surveillance and
                certificate renewal assessments.
              </li>

              <li>
                The type of corrective action against any misuse will depends on
                the nature of the misuse and its subsequent consequences.
              </li>

              <li>
                Any misuse of the certificate by the clients brought to the
                notice of NIWE by any third party or noticed by NIWE may result
                in suspension or withdrawal of the certification by NIWE. NIWE’s
                considerations with respect to suspension or withdrawal will be
                as follows:
              </li>

              <ol style="list-style-type: square">
                <li>
                  Inadvertent misuse: with this activity, the organization will
                  be required to immediately withdraw the offending materials,
                  or NIWE will suspend certification until the misuse is
                  rectified. Repeated inadvertent misuse will not be tolerated
                  by NIWE and therefore will be cause for withdrawal of
                  certification.
                </li>

                <li>
                  Misuse: with an activity considered premeditated on the part
                  of the organization, NIWE will withdraw certification and
                  publish notices to that effect in the directory of certified
                  companies.
                </li>
              </ol>
              <li>
                When misuses refuse to take corrective action, NIWE has the
                rights to terminate the certificate, to inform the regulatory
                authority and also to take any legal proceedings.
              </li>

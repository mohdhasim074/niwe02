                 <h4>Introduction</h4>
              </div> 
              <p>Wind and solar energy have become an integral part of Global energy mix. As on July 2019, the country has the installed capacity of 66.8GW of grid connected wind and solar generation along with 1GW (approximate) of off grid connected solar power plants. To accelerate the installation of wind and solar power in the country, the Government of India has set a target of 60 GW from wind and 100 GW from solar for 2022 and to have at least 40% renewable power capacity by 2030. The resource assessment is the critical elements for developing wind and solar power plant.</p>
               <br>
               <p>The journey of resource assessment was driven by the vision and tireless efforts from the wind and solar community right from the early seventies. Measuring and assessing the wind and solar resource potential of the country became the natural first step which then found its natural progression in the development of Renewable sector.</p>
               <br>
              <p>A concerted efforts on the resource assessment has picked up its pace when the Government mandated National Institute of Wind Energy (NIWE) formerly Centre for Wind Energy Technology (CWET) for Resource Assessment in the country for both wind and solar. NIWE started the wind resource assessment program in the year 2000 and the solar program in 2011. Several efforts for resource measurements followed with active participation and investment from the private sector and State Nodal Agencies which were parallely taken up. These collective efforts by all the stakeholders created the strong foundation on which the wind sector grew and became as established as we see today.</p> 
                <br>
                <p>The first Indian wind map was prepared and published in year 2004 for 50m hub height. In 2010 NIWE prepared 50m, 80m height Wind Atlas with updated techniques and estimated potential in the country as 49 GW and 102 GW respectively. As the hub height of the turbine is increasing, NIWE prepared and released 100m Wind Atlas in September 2015 with the estimated potential of 302 GW and is on the verge of releasing the 120m Atlas. The 150m height wind atlas with advanced technique is under progress.</p>
                <br>
                <p>However, it was Prof. Dr. Anna Modayil Mani who pioneered in resource assessment and took the first visionary step of carrying out Pan India campaign of measuring and assessing the wind and solar resource potential.</p>
                <br>
                <p>To tribute and celebrate, the birth centenary of Prof. Dr. Anna Mani as the Wind Resource Day 23rd August 2019.</p>

                 <h4>WIND & SOLAR RESOURCE ASSESSMENT</h4>
                </div>
                 <p>Wind and solar resources assessment work in India contributions to the field of meteorological started way back in 1970s. National Wind Resource Assessment program was launched in 1985 by the Government of India to assess the potential with actual measurements, wherein Prof. Dr. Anna Mani played a crucial role. Currently 896 wind monitoring stations were established under program. Further about 1100 private wind monitoring stations are also established in the country, thanks to the “Guidelines for Wind Measurement by Private Sector” released by MNRE in June 2008. In total, India holds a data bank for about 2000 wind-monitoring stations, which is one of the largest in the world.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>Prof. Anna Mani published the Handbook for Solar Radiation Data for India in 1980 and Solar Radiation over India in 1981 and in 1990s, her efforts saw the publication of Wind Resource Survey in India series Volume I to V. NIWE continued the publishing of remaining volumes from Vol. VI to Vol. IX through its measurements campaigns.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>These measurements and survey volumes helped in the potential estimation of the country in a welldefined way.</p>
                 <br>
                 <p>The solar radiation data in the country till 2010 was challenging due to non-availability of bankable and investor grade ground measured solar data. It was a major hurdle in the implementation of solar power projects in the country. To overcome these challenges MNRE launched a national program in 2010 for the establishment of a network of Solar Radiation Resource Assessment (SRRA) stations to collect solar radiation resource data measuring Global Horizontal Irradiance (GHI), Direct Normal Irradiance (DNI), Diffuse Horizontal Irradiance (DHI) and associated meteorological parameters in a phased manner through NIWE, by establishing an exclusive project called SRRA. Under this program, 
                     115 stations have been established, out of these SRRA stations, 4 advanced measurement stations also have been commissioned in the country to collect site ciceps attenuation of solar radiation due to various atmospheric constituents and these 4 stations are part of the prestigious BSRN (Baseline Solar Radiation Network) an arm of world climate research programme (WCRP) of World Meteorological Organization (WMO). India and Japan are two countries in Asia that are in this prestigious network.</p>
